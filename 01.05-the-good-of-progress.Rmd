# The Good of Progress

Here are some pressure points for the entire Western intellectual tradition. Let’s take them in turn and then braid them back into Lonergan’s arc of progress/decline.

## Is the whole greater than the sum of the parts?

We’re right to plant our flag firmly in the *affirmative* and not just rhetorically — metaphysically, epistemologically, ethically.

### Why the objectors fail

- **Bacon** reduces intelligibility to empirical fragments, so of course he can’t see emergent form.  
- **Scientism** collapses all explanation into mechanism, so it literally cannot *see* wholes.  
- **Reductionist neuroscience** treats consciousness as epiphenomenal chemistry, which is like explaining Hamlet by analyzing the ink.  
- And yes — if one is going to reduce thought to chemistry, why stop there? Why not reduce chemistry to QED amplitudes? Why not reduce *those* to the vacuum state? [Reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism) always eats itself. It refutes itself in a classical _retorquendo_ move.

### Why the affirmative is the only coherent position

A whole is not a pile of stuff. A whole is a *form*, a *pattern*, an *intelligibility* that:

- organizes the parts,  
- conditions their relations,  
- and generates emergent properties irreducible to the components.

This is Aristotle → Aquinas → Lonergan → modern complexity theory.

We’re defending the very possibility of **intelligibility**, **meaning**, and **value**.

## Is deduction new knowledge?

Again, your affirmative stance is exactly right — and Lonergan gives you the conceptual artillery.

### Why the skeptics deny it

- **Hume**: deduction is analytic tautology.  
- **Locke**: the mind is a passive container; deduction rearranges ideas but adds nothing.  
- **Kant**: synthetic a priori is possible, but deduction itself is not knowledge of being — it is only the structuring of appearances.  
- **Callicles, Sartre, Nietzsche (in his early phase)**: knowledge is power-play, not insight.

All of these positions share a single root:  **they deny that understanding is a real grasp of intelligibility in being.**

If knowing is not *being-in-contact-with-reality*, then deduction is just linguistic shuffling.

### Lonergan’s counter-position

Lonergan’s breakthrough is that **insight transforms data**, and **judgment transforms insight**. Deduction is not mechanical manipulation — it is:

- the unfolding of the intelligibility grasped in insight,  
- the extension of understanding into new domains,  
- the discovery of implications that were *not* present to consciousness before.

Deduction is new knowledge because **the mind is dynamically self-transcending**.

## Progress and Decline: Why These Two Questions Matter

We connect these metaphysical questions to Lonergan’s moral-historical cycle.

### Progress

Progress occurs when:
- the mind affirms that wholes exist (intelligibility is real),  
- the mind trusts its own capacity for insight and judgment,  
- the community orients itself toward the good of the neighbor,  
- and the good of order expands to include the vulnerable.

This is the *yes* to being, to intelligibility, to value, to God.

### Decline

Decline is not random. It is the predictable result of:
- reductionism (no wholes),  
- skepticism (no new knowledge),  
- individualism (no neighbor),  
- and self-enclosure (no transcendence).

Decline is the *no* to being, the *no* to intelligibility, the *no* to the neighbor, the *no* to God.

It is privation, deflection, and self-protection masquerading as realism.

## Our Position, Stated Cleanly

We’re defending a metaphysics and epistemology that make:

- **emergence possible**,  
- **insight real**,  
- **deduction fruitful**,  
- **progress intelligible**,  
- **decline diagnosable**,  
- **and the good of the neighbor non-negotiable**.

This is not “same old - same old.”  This is the beating heart of a humane, theologically grounded, intellectually rigorous worldview.

## Then there's uncertainty

We’re reaching for exactly the right *nerve center*: the moment in Nicholas Cusanus, **_De Docta Ignorantia_ I.3–4** where @cusanus_ddi_english articulates (a) the **impossibility theorem**—finite reason cannot ground or explain itself—and (b) the **coincidentia oppositorum** as the only horizon in which inquiry can proceed at all.

Below is the passage most directly expressing the “impossibility theorem” and the “coincidence of opposites” as a condition of possibility for wonder, inquiry, and analogy.

### De Docta Ignorantia (herein, _DDI_) I.3–4

#### On the impossibility of science grounding itself

_Cum igitur omne cognoscibile mensurari oporteat mensura propria, mensura autem infinita finitam mensuram excedat, impossibile est scientiam de infinito secundum propriam rationem haberi._
(*DDI* I.3)

“Since everything knowable must be measured by its proper measure, and since the infinite exceeds every finite measure, it is impossible to have a science of the infinite according to its own proper rational method.”

This is the core of Cusa’s “impossibility theorem”: **science cannot explain or ground itself**, because the very act of knowing presupposes a measure that finite reason cannot supply.

#### On the coincidence of opposites as the horizon of wonder and understanding

_In infinito autem, ubi omnium oppositorum coincidentia est, nostra mens, quae per differentias intelligit, deficit; et in hoc deficit, ut mirari discat._
( _DDI_ I.4)

“But in the Infinite, where the coincidence of all opposites is found, our mind—which understands by means of differences—fails; and in this very failing it learns to wonder.”

Here we stand.

- finite reason fails,  
- but the failure is **fruitful**,  
- because it opens onto wonder,  
- which is the condition for analogy (Przywara),  
- and the border-logic Wittgenstein intuits (a boundary presupposes two sides).

### On the necessity of coincidence for any knowledge at all

_Quoniam igitur in Deo, qui est omnium mensura, opposita coincidunt, mens nostra, quae in oppositis haeret, ad veritatem nisi in docta ignorantia non ascendit._
( _DDI_ I.4)

“Since in God, who is the measure of all things, opposites coincide, our mind—which clings to opposites—cannot ascend to truth except through learned ignorance.”

This is the metaphysical ground of Przywara’s *analogia entis*:  

- God is the coincidence of opposites,  
- creatures are the “ever greater dissimilarity,”  
- analogy is the oscillation between similarity and dissimilarity,  
- wonder is the epistemic posture proper to this oscillation.

}

#### Wittgenstein’s border‑logic

The key line is **Tractatus 5.6**:

> *“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”*  
> (*Tractatus* 5.6)

This is the passage that resonates with Cusa’s *docta ignorantia*:

- A **limit** is not a wall but a **border**.  
- A border implies **two sides**.  
- What lies beyond the limit is not nonsense but the **condition** for meaningful sense.  
- Language cannot contain the whole, but its very limit points to the whole.

This is why the *Tractatus* ends with the famous 7th note:

> *“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”*  
> (*Tractatus* 7)

Silence here is not negation — it is **reverence**, the philosophical analogue of Cusa’s wonder.

How might this connect Cusa-to-Wittgenstein-to-Przywara?

- **Cusa**: The mind fails at the infinite, and in failing learns to wonder.  
- **Wittgenstein**: The limit of language is the border where meaning opens beyond itself.  
- **Przywara**: The creature exists in a rhythmic tension of similarity and ever‑greater dissimilarity to God — the *analogia entis*.

All three converge on a single insight:

**The limit is not the end of understanding but the beginning of wisdom.**^[Nicolaus Cusanus articulates the foundational limit of finite reason in _De Docta Ignorantia_ I.3–4 (@cusanus_ddi_english), where he argues that the infinite exceeds every finite measure and therefore cannot be grasped by any science that presupposes its own rational method: “_Cum igitur omne cognoscibile mensurari oporteat mensura propria, mensura autem infinita finitam mensuram excedat, impossibile est scientiam de infinito secundum propriam rationem haberi_.” He next develops the epistemic consequence: “_In infinito autem, ubi omnium oppositorum coincidentia est, nostra mens, quae per differentias intelligit, deficit; et in hoc deficit, ut mirari discat_.” The mind in a finite universe with a finite body (brain at least) falters right at the boundary of its own powers, yet the falling down is fruitful, for it reaches out with wonder. This border‑logic anticipates Wittgenstein’s insight that a boundary presupposes two regions — one on either side — and that what lies beyond the limit of language is not nonsense but the very condition of meaningful speech, and thus of meaningful communication of analytical results to consumers of the analysis. @przywara_analogia develops the Cusanus structure into the rhythmic, cyclic “ever greater dissimilarity” of the _analogia entis,_ where creaturely, finite being is constituted by the tension between similarity and dissimilarity to the divine, the ever more relative to the creature. Thus, Cusa’s _coincidentia oppositorum_ is not a collapse of distinctions but the metaphysical horizon within which analogy, wonder, and inquiry become possible.]
