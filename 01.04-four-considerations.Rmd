A _quaestio_ is a consideration, in question form, for discussion, debate, formation, development of principles for analytics design.

## QUAESTIO I. Whether the Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of the Parts

#### Objections

##### Objection 1 — Baconian Empiricism  

One reading of Francis Bacon holds that knowledge arises from the accumulation of discrete observations, and that wholes are nothing but aggregates of parts. Emergent form is dismissed as a projection of the mind.  

Reference: @bacon_novum, _Novum Organum_, Book I.

##### Objection 2 — Scientistic Reductionism  

Contemporary scientism asserts that all phenomena are reducible to physical components and their interactions. Consciousness, meaning, and value are epiphenomena of chemistry.  

Reference: Alex @rosenberg_atheist, _The Atheist’s Guide to Reality_.

##### Objection 3 — Neuroscientific Materialism  

Some neuroscientists claim that thought is nothing but neural firing patterns, and thus any “whole” is merely shorthand for chemical processes.  

Reference: Patricia @churchland_neurophilosophy, _Neurophilosophy_.

##### Objection 4 — Mechanistic Physics  

If physics reduces systems to fundamental particles and forces, then any “whole” is simply the sum of microphysical states.  

Reference: Steven @weinberg_final_theory, _Dreams of a Final Theory_

### On the Contrary

Aristotle teaches that a whole possesses a _form_ that organizes the parts and gives them their intelligibility.  

Reference: @aristotle_metaphysics, _Metaphysics_ VIII.6.

Aquinas affirms that form is “that by which a thing is what it is,” and that wholes possess properties irreducible to their components.  

Reference: @aquinas_st, _Summa Theologiae_ I, q.76, a.8.

Lonergan argues that intelligibility is grasped in insight, not reducible to data alone.  

Reference: Bernard @lonergan_insight, _Insight_, ch. 1–3.

### I Respond That

I answer that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of the parts, not by addition but by emergent intelligibility. A whole is constituted by:

- Form (Aristotle, Aquinas)  
- Higher-order relations (Lonergan’s “schemes of recurrence”)  
- Contextual unity (Polanyi’s “tacit integration”)  
- Functional organization (modern complexity theory)

The parts do not explain the whole; rather, the whole explains the parts.

Reductionism fails because:

1. It cannot account for emergence (life, consciousness, culture).  
2. It cannot account for meaning (semantics is not chemistry).  
3. It cannot account for value (ethics is not physics).  
4. It cannot account for intelligibility (insight is not reducible to data).

Thus, the whole is ontologically and epistemically prior to the parts. This is the foundation for any humane analytics: data points are not reality; they are fragments awaiting intelligible integration.

### Replies to Objections

#### Reply to Objection 1 (Bacon)  

Bacon’s empiricism mistakes accumulation for understanding. Insight is not a sum of observations but a grasp of form.

#### Reply to Objection 2 (Scientism)  

Scientism is self-refuting: the claim “only physical explanations are valid” is not itself a physical explanation.

#### Reply to Objection 3 (Neuroscience)  

Neural correlates do not exhaust mental acts. Correlation is not identity. Thought transcends its material substrate.

#### Reply to Objection 4 (Physics)  

Physics describes interactions, not intelligibility. Meaning, purpose, and organization are not derivable from microphysical laws.

## QUAESTIO II. Whether Deduction Produces New Knowledge

#### Objections

##### Objection 1 — Humean Skepticism  

Hume argues that deduction is analytic and tautological, adding nothing to knowledge.  

Reference: David @hume_enquiry, _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_, Section IV.

##### Objection 2 — Locke’s Passivity of Mind  

Locke holds that the mind merely rearranges simple ideas; deduction is recombination, not discovery.  

Reference: John @locke_essay, _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_, Book II.

##### Objection 3 — Kantian Formalism  

Kant claims deduction structures appearances but does not give knowledge of things-in-themselves.  

Reference: Immanuel @kant_cpr, _Critique of Pure Reason_, A6–7.

##### Objection 4 — Nihilistic Power-Epistemologies  

Callicles, an early Nietzsche, and Sartre reduce knowledge to power, rendering deduction a tool of domination rather than discovery.  

References: @plato_gorgias, _Gorgias_; Friedrich @nietzsche_genealogy, _Genealogy of Morals_; Jean-Paul @sartre_bn, _Being and Nothingness_.

### On the Contrary

Lonergan teaches that understanding is a dynamic, self-transcending process: insight → formulation → verification. Deduction unfolds the intelligibility grasped in insight.  

Reference: Bernard @lonergan_insight, _Insight_, ch. 2–4.

Aquinas affirms that reasoning extends knowledge by drawing out implications latent in principles.  

Reference: @aquinas_st, _Summa Theologiae_ I, q.79, a.8.

### I Respond That

I answer that deduction does indeed produce new knowledge, because:

1. Insight grasps a form, but deduction articulates its implications.  
2. Judgment affirms reality, and deduction extends that affirmation.  
3. Understanding is developmental, not static.  
4. Implications are not present to consciousness until reason unfolds them.

Thus, deduction is not mechanical manipulation but the expansion of intelligibility. It reveals what was implicit but not yet known.

This is essential for analytics: models, regressions, and forecasts are not mere computations — they are the unfolding of intelligibility grasped in data.

### Replies to Objections

#### Reply to Objection 1 (Hume)

Hume’s empiricism cannot account for mathematics, science, or even his own argument. Deduction is not tautology; it is the unfolding of insight.

#### Reply to Objection 2 (Locke)  

The mind is not passive. Insight is an active grasp of form, and deduction extends that grasp.

#### Reply to Objection 3 (Kant)  

Kant’s restriction of knowledge to appearances is a metaphysical decision, not a discovery. Deduction reveals real intelligibility.

#### Reply to Objection 4 (Nihilists)  

If knowledge is only power, then the claim “knowledge is power” is itself a power-play and not knowledge. This is self-referentially incoherent.

The third and next _quaestio_ is the keystone — the one that makes the first two _operative_ in a Stats/Analytics classroom.

## QUAESTIO III. Whether Philosophical and Theological Considerations Should Guide an Empirically Oriented Management Analytics Course

### Objections

#### Objection 1 — Milton Friedman’s Value-Neutral Economics  

Friedman argues that the sole responsibility of business is to increase profits within the rules of the game. Ethics, theology, and philosophy are “externalities” irrelevant to managerial decision-making.  

Reference: Friedman, “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits,” _NYT Magazine_ (1970).

#### Objection 2 — Neoclassical Economics and Methodological Individualism 

Mainstream economics treats agents as utility-maximizing individuals and assumes that aggregate welfare emerges automatically from self-interest. Normative considerations are dismissed as unscientific.  

Reference: Hal @varian_micro, _Microeconomic Analysis_; @samuelson_nordhaus, _Economics_.

#### Objection 3 — Cartesian Mechanism  

Descartes reduces living beings to automata and treats nature as a machine. By analogy, management becomes the manipulation of mechanical parts (employees, processes, markets) rather than the stewardship of persons.  

Reference: Ren\'e @descartes_treatise, _Treatise on Man_.

#### Objection 4 — Turing’s Computationalism  

If thinking is reducible to algorithmic computation, then analytics is simply the execution of procedures. Philosophy and theology add nothing to the correctness of outputs.  

Reference: Alan @turing_imitation_game, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.”

#### Objection 5 — Positivist Managerialism  

The positivist tradition holds that only empirical, measurable data count as knowledge. Values, meaning, and purpose are subjective and therefore inadmissible in a scientific curriculum.  

Reference: Auguste @comte_positive_philosophy, _Course of Positive Philosophy_.

#### Objection 6 — Pragmatic Technocracy  

Some argue that managers need tools, not metaphysics. Philosophy slows decision-making; theology is sectarian; analytics should be efficient, not contemplative.  

Reference: Herbert @simon_admin_behavior , _Administrative Behavior_ (instrumental rationality).

### On the Contrary

Aquinas teaches that every human act is ordered toward an end, and that ends are discerned through reason informed by virtue.  

Reference: St. Thomas @aquinas_st, _Summa Theologiae_ I–II, q.1, a.1.

Lonergan argues that authentic inquiry requires attentiveness, intelligence, reasonableness, and responsibility — norms that are philosophical and theological before they are empirical.  

Reference: Bernard @lonergan_insight, _Insight_, ch. 18–20.

Catholic social teaching affirms that economic and managerial decisions must serve the dignity of the human person and the common good.  

Reference: @vat2_gaudium_et_spes, _Gaudium et Spes_; @francis_laudato, _Laudato Si’_; @benedict_caritas,  _Caritas in Veritate_.

### I Respond That

I answer that philosophical and theological considerations must guide an empirically oriented management analytics course, because analytics is never value-neutral. Every model presupposes:

- a view of the human person,  
- a theory of value,  
- a conception of the good,  
- and a telos toward which decisions are directed.

Empirical methods alone cannot supply these. They require a prior anthropology, ethics, and metaphysics.

Furthermore:

1. Data are fragments; philosophy provides the intelligible whole.  
2. Models encode assumptions about rationality, agency, and value; theology and ethics test these assumptions.  
3. Analytics affects real people, especially the vulnerable; stewardship requires moral discernment.  
4. Management is a moral practice, not merely a technical one.  
5. Without philosophical grounding, analytics becomes technocratic power, not service.

Thus, philosophy and theology do not constrain analytics — they liberate it to serve the common good, to avoid decline, and to participate in the progress Lonergan describes: the expansion of the good of order for every neighbor without exception.

### Replies to Objections

#### Reply to Objection 1 (Friedman)  

Friedman’s claim that business is value-neutral is itself a value-laden philosophical position. It cannot justify itself empirically and collapses into moral minimalism.

#### Reply to Objection 2 (Neoclassical Economics)  

Methodological individualism is a metaphysical choice, not a scientific discovery. It ignores relationality, solidarity, and the common good.

#### Reply to Objection 3 (Descartes)  

Human beings are not automata. Treating them as such leads to managerial dehumanization and organizational decline.

#### Reply to Objection 4 (Turing)  

Even if computation can simulate reasoning, it cannot supply meaning, purpose, or value. Analytics requires judgment, not just algorithms.

#### Reply to Objection 5 (Positivism)  

Positivism is self-refuting: the claim “only empirical statements are meaningful” is not itself empirical.

#### Reply to Objection 6 (Technocracy)

Efficiency without wisdom is dangerous. Analytics without ethics becomes manipulation; analytics with philosophy becomes stewardship.

## QUAESTIO IV. Whether the Problem of Evil Is Intelligible as a Failure of Consciousness and a Distortion of the Good of Order

#### Objections

##### Objection 1 — Classical Theodicy (Leibniz, Clarke)  
S
ome argue that evil is a metaphysical necessity in the “best of all possible worlds,” and thus cannot be reduced to human failure or historical distortion.  

Reference: @leibniz_theodicy, _Theodicy_.

##### Objection 2 — Augustinian Privation Alone  

Others hold that evil is simply a privation of good, lacking positive intelligibility. If evil is only absence, it cannot be analyzed as a structured failure of consciousness.  

Reference: @augustine_enchiridion, _Enchiridion_.

##### Objection 3 — Marxist Structuralism  

Marx locates evil in material conditions and class structures, not in consciousness. Thus, decline is economic, not intellectual or moral.  

Reference: @marx_manuscripts, _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts_.

##### Objection 4 — Nietzschean Genealogy  

Nietzsche claims that “evil” is a construct of ressentiment, not an intelligible failure. Decline is the triumph of the weak, not a distortion of the good.  

Reference: Friedrich @nietzsche_genealogy, _Genealogy of Morals_.

##### Objection 5 — Secular Technocracy  

Modern managerialism holds that problems are technical, not moral or intellectual. Evil is inefficiency; decline is mismanagement; consciousness is irrelevant.  

Reference: Herbert @simon_admin_behavior, _Administrative Behavior_.

### On the contrary

Lonergan writes in _Insight_ that “the root of evil is the flight from understanding,” and that decline is “the cumulative effect of unauthenticity in the operations of consciousness.”  
Reference: _Insight_, ch. 7–8.

In _De Redemptione_, he reads Marx and Nietzsche as diagnosing real distortions of the human good, but lacking the horizon of redemption that makes intelligibility whole.  
Reference: Lonergan, _De Redemptione_ (Gregorian lectures).

In his _Political Economy_ essays and _Economic Dynamics_, he argues that economic breakdowns are not merely technical failures but the result of “bias, short-sightedness, and the refusal of responsibility.”  
Reference: Lonergan, _For a New Political Economy_; _Macroeconomic Dynamics_.

### I Respond That

I answer that the problem of evil is indeed intelligible as a failure of consciousness and a distortion of the good of order.

Lonergan’s unified account proceeds in four movements:

#### 1. Evil begins in the subject

Evil is not first a metaphysical puzzle or a cosmic defect.  
It begins in the refusal of attentiveness, intelligence, reasonableness, and responsibility — the transcendental precepts that constitute authentic subjectivity.

This is the “flight from understanding.”

#### 2. Evil becomes historical through bias  

Individual refusals accumulate into:

- dramatic bias (self-deception),  
- individual bias (egoism),  
- group bias (exclusion, domination),  
- general bias (anti-intellectualism, technocracy).

These biases distort the good of order, the patterned cooperation that sustains human flourishing.

#### 3. Decline becomes systemic  

Lonergan’s Political Economy of the 1940s and his Economic Dynamics of the 1980s show that:

- economic breakdowns,  
- colonial exploitation,  
- global inequality,  
- ecological devastation,  
- technological hypertrophy (e.g., nuclear capability)

are not merely technical failures. They are cumulative consequences of inauthentic consciousness.

#### 4. Redemption is the reversal of decline  

In _De Redemptione_, Lonergan integrates Marx and Nietzsche into a theological horizon:

- Marx diagnoses structural distortion.  
- Nietzsche diagnoses cultural and moral decay.  
- Lonergan diagnoses the root: the refusal of transcendence.

Redemption is not magic; it is the healing of consciousness, the restoration of authenticity, and the reconstitution of the good of order.

Thus, evil is intelligible — not as a metaphysical necessity, but as a historical, cumulative, and reversible failure of consciousness.

### Replies to Objections

#### Reply to Objection 1 (Leibniz)  

Metaphysical optimism ignores the historical, cumulative character of decline. Lonergan’s account is not metaphysical but existential and historical.

#### Reply to Objection 2 (Augustine)  

Privation is correct metaphysically, but insufficient historically. Decline has structure, pattern, and intelligibility.

#### Reply to Objection 3 (Marx)  

Marx sees the symptoms but not the root. Structures distort because consciousness distorts.

#### Reply to Objection 4 (Nietzsche)  

Nietzsche’s genealogy unmasks moral decay but cannot account for authentic moral transcendence.

#### Reply to Objection 5 (Technocracy)  

Technocracy is itself a form of general bias — the refusal to acknowledge the moral and intellectual roots of decline.

If Q4 establishes the _inverse insight_ that the intelligibility of evil is a failure of consciousness, Q5 asks whether the reversal of that evil — structural, global, cumulative — is possible within human capability alone.

Your framing is exactly Lonergan’s:  
- decline is intelligible,  
- decline is cumulative,  
- decline is self-reinforcing,  
- and decline eventually exceeds the power of unaided human capability to reverse.

This is where the contrast with Sen and Nussbaum becomes illuminating. They see the yearning (*oregesthai*) but not the horizon toward which the yearning is ordered.

## QUAESTIO V. Whether the Reversal of Structural Decline and Global Evil Is Possible Within Human Capability Alone

### Objections

#### Objection 1 — Sen’s Capability Approach

Sen argues that human flourishing depends on expanding capabilities — freedoms to do and to be. If structural evil is a deprivation of capability, then its reversal lies in expanding human agency.  

Reference: Amartya @sen_development_as_freedom, *Development as Freedom*.

#### Objection 2 — Nussbaum’s Virtue-Capability Synthesis  

Nussbaum grounds capabilities in a neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics. Human beings “reach for” (*oregesthai*) their flourishing through cultivated virtues. Thus, moral and political reform is possible through human development alone.  

Reference: Martha @nussbaum_creating_capabilities, *Creating Capabilities*.

#### Objection 3 — Secular Humanism  

Human progress has historically overcome disease, poverty, and injustice. Structural evil is a technical and political challenge, not a metaphysical one.  

Reference: Steven @pinker_enlightenment_now, *Enlightenment Now*.

#### Objection 4 — Marxist Praxis

Structural evil is rooted in material conditions. Transforming those conditions through collective action is sufficient for reversing decline.  

Reference: Karl @marx_manuscripts, *Theses on Feuerbach*, 1844.

#### Objection 5 — Nietzschean Self-Overcoming  

Human beings can overcome decadence through the will-to-power and the creation of new values. No transcendent horizon is needed.  

Reference: Friedrich @nietzsche_zarathustra *Thus spoke Zarathustra*, 1885.

### On the contrary

Lonergan writes that “the cumulative product of unauthenticity is decline,” and that decline becomes “a surd, a nonsense, a horror” that exceeds the power of unaided human intelligence and will.  

Reference: Bernard @lonergan_insight*Insight*, ch. 7–8.

In *De Redemptione*, he argues that the healing of history requires a transformation “beyond the resources of human nature,” grounded in the divine self-communication
.  
Reference: Bernard @lonergan_de_redemptione, *De Redemptione* (Gregorian lectures).

Catholic social teaching affirms that structural sin requires conversion, grace, and a horizon of transcendence.  

Reference: @johnpaul_sollicitudo_rei_socialis *Sollicitudo Rei Socialis*; @vat2_gaudium_et_spes *Gaudium et Spes*.

### I respond that

I answer that the reversal of structural decline and global evil is not possible within human capability alone.

#### 1. Structural evil is cumulative and self-reinforcing  

Lonergan’s analysis shows that:

- individual bias  
- group bias  
- general bias  
- and dramatic bias

all compound into structural sin — patterns of cooperation that systematically harm the vulnerable and distort the good of order.

Once entrenched, these structures exceed the power of individual or collective goodwill.

#### 2. Human capability is necessary but insufficient  

Sen and Nussbaum correctly identify the human yearning (*orexis*) for flourishing. But they lack the horizon of vertical transcendence:

- the yearning is real,  
- but the fulfillment lies beyond human self-assertion,  
- because the wound, teh vulnerability, is deeper than human capability.

#### 3. Sin is not merely personal but historical  

Lonergan’s reading of history shows that:

- decline becomes global (and greater than the sum of the nations, regions, tribes, families),  
- decline becomes cultural (norms, values, stories, binding ),  
- decline becomes economic (the material well-being of the good of order),  
- decline becomes ecological (all connected, bio-, psycho-, socio-, anthropo-logical),  
- decline becomes technological (the works of our hands, nuclear capability, AI misuse, extractive capitalism).

This is original sin writ communally, not metaphorically but structurally.

#### 4. The solution requires a surplus of meaning, value, and love 

- Human capability can diagnose decline.  
- Human capability can mitigate decline.  
- But human capability cannot reverse decline.

Reversal requires:
 
- conversion,  
- grace, an unforced generosity,  
- a new horizon of meaning,  
- the divine self-communication Lonergan calls “God’s love flooding our hearts.”

This is not pious sentiment.It is the only adequate response to a problem that has exceeded and will necessarily exceed human scope and scale.

#### 5. The yearning (*oregesthai*) points beyond itself

@nussbaum_fragility_of_goodness uses the medio-passive *oregesthai*,and it is telling:

- “to reach for,
- “to stretch toward,”  
- “to long for.”

But what is the object of this yearning?

Lonergan’s answer: _the unrestricted desire to know, to love, to be — the desire for God._

Thus, the very structure, the design itself, of human capability points beyond itself.

### Replies to Objections

#### Reply to Objection 1 (Sen)

Capabilities expand agency but cannot heal the root of decline: bias and unauthenticity.

#### Reply to Objection 2 (Nussbaum)  

Virtue is necessary, but without transcendence it becomes Pelagian — insufficient for structural evil.

#### Reply to Objection 3 (Secular Humanism)  

Technological progress does not reverse moral or structural decline; it often amplifies it.

#### Reply to Objection 4 (Marx)  

Material transformation without conversion reproduces the same distortions under new forms.

#### Reply to Objection 5 (Nietzsche)  

Self-overcoming cannot overcome the self-enclosure that constitutes decline.

This last _quaestio_ is extraordinary in the sense it is the whole that pulls together the parts, yet is subservient to the principles of the whole exceeding the parts. It begins tp completes the arc:

1. The whole exceeds the parts.  
2. Deduction yields new knowledge.  
3. Analytics requires philosophy and theology.  
4. Evil is intelligible as a failure of consciousness.  

Reversal requires transcendence beyond human capability.
