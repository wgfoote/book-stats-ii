abstract = {This paper examines the economic justification for the use of differential tariffs to control for positive and negative externalities embodied in traded products. In particular, economic efficiency requires that taxes and subsidies should be applied to internalize external costs or benefits. It is argued that products such as timber, minerals, and agricultural products that produce large negative environmental externalities should be differentially tariffed to either provide an incentive to cease destructive practices, or provide funding for amelioration. Examples from the mining and agricultural sectors are used to demonstrate the magnitude of tariffs required to offset the estimated environmental damage. Products with embedded cultural content are used as examples of exports that may possess positive externalities, and should be subject to a subsidy.}

Quote: It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards. And if one thinks over that proposition it becomes more and more evident that life can never really be understood in time simply because at no particular moment can I find the necessary resting-place from which to understand it—backwards.

title = "A tutorial on testing hypotheses using the Bayes factor",
abstract = "Learning about hypothesis evaluation using the Bayes factor could enhance psychological research. In contrast to null-hypothesis significance testing it renders the evidence in favor of each of the hypotheses under consideration (it can be used to quantify support for the null-hypothesis) instead of a dichotomous reject/do-not-reject decision; it can straightforwardly be used for the evaluation of multiple hypotheses without having to bother about the proper manner to account for multiple testing; and it allows continuous reevaluation of hypotheses after additional data have been collected (Bayesian updating). This tutorial addresses researchers considering to evaluate their hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used. It will be elaborated in a completely nontechnical manner: what the Bayes factor is, how it can be obtained, how Bayes factors should be interpreted, and what can be done with Bayes factors. After reading this tutorial and executing the associated code, researchers will be able to use their own data for the evaluation of hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor, not only in the context of ANOVA models, but also in the context of other statistical models.",

The mathematical problem associated with this approach is developed first in general notation and then in term sof a dynamic system of equations expressed in matrix notation. Typical problems from the fields of inter-industryrelations, transportation nutrition, warehouse storage, and air transport are given in the last section.},

abstract = {This paper presents an operational metric for univariate unimodal probability distributions with finite first moments in [0,1], where 0 is maximally thin-tailed (Gaussian) and 1 is maximally fat-tailed. It is based on the question, “how much data does one need to make meaningful statements about a given dataset?” Applications: Among others, it •helps to determine the sample size n needed for statistical significance outside the Gaussian distribution,•helps to measure the speed of convergence to the Gaussian (or stable basin),•allows practical comparisons across classes of fat-tailed distributions,•allows the number of securities needed in portfolio construction to achieve a certain level of risk-reduction from diversification to be assessed,•helps in assessing risks under various settings, and•helps to explain some inconsistent attributes of the lognormal, depending on the parametrization of its variance. The literature in regard to asymptotic behavior is rich, but there is a large void regarding finite values of n, which are those that are needed for operational purposes. Background: Conventional measures of fat-tailedness, namely (1) the tail index for the power law class, and (2) the kurtosis for finite moment distributions, fail to apply to some distributions, and do not allow comparisons across classes and parametrization; that is, between power laws outside the Levy-stable basin, or power laws and distributions in other classes, or power laws for different numbers of summands. How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t distributed random variables with three degrees of freedom to one in a Levy-stable or a Lognormal class? How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t with three degrees of freedom to a single Student t with two degrees of freedom? We propose an operational and heuristic metric that allows us to compare n-summed independent variables under all distributions with finite first moments. The method is based on the rate of convergence of the law of large numbers for finite sums, specifically n-summands. We get either explicit expressions or simulation results and bounds for the lognormal, exponential, Pareto, and Student t distributions in their various calibrations, in addition to the general Pearson classes.}

    abstract = { The dialectic is a very ancient device long used to comprehend historical process. Its versatility as a tool for informing on numerous issues of interest to those involved in futures studies is self-evident yet under-appreciated, not as a predicting device but as a framing one, much as with how catalysts work in chemistry. This piece first briefly describes the basics of the dialectical process and its application as an outcome framing method. Its connections with other forecasting methods especially with emerging issues analysis is discussed. The properties of dialectical processes are dynamic and do not necessarily conform to human-scale either temporally or spatially. Dialectical process related to social change and worldview are not subordinate to cyclic time except when artificially imposed as with political elections. The dialectical process being consistent with quantum mechanics especially as applied to technological impacts and legal enactment process will be discussed. In the latter instance, the dark matter and dark energy conundrum bear the hallmarks of a dialectical process thus far leading to an indeterminable resolution. While several examples of persistent issue contradictions to which dialectical analysis can be usefully applied are available, American health care policy is highlighted here. }

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.  The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.  Features   Integrates working code into the main text   Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples   Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code   Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections   Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs   Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub},

We analyze with various estimators how these relationships are affected by foreign aid flows by focusing on 78 developing countries for 1984-2008. Both types of terrorism are found to depress FDI. Aggregate aid mitigates the negative consequences of domestic and transnational terrorism, but this aid appears more robust in ameliorating the adverse effect of domestic terrorism. However, when aid is subdivided, bilateral aid is effective in reducing the adverse effects of transnational terrorism on FDI, whereas multilateral aid is effective in curbing the adverse effects of domestic terrorism on FDI. For transnational terrorism, there is evidence in the literature that donor countries earmark some bilateral aid to counterterrorism. Aid ability to curb the risk to FDI from terrorism is important because FDI is an important engine of development.}",

These data sets are then used to display some stylized facts about domestic and transnational terrorism during the past four decades. Next, some essential strategic distinctions are drawn between defensive and proactive measures in the case of transnational terrorism when multiple countries are confronted by a common terrorist group. These strategic concerns vanish for domestic terrorism as a central government is able to internalize potential externalities. Finally, the key findings of the articles in the special issue are highlighted in two tables.}",

The method, called Interactive Sequential Goal Programming (ISGP), combines and extends the attractive features of both Goal Programming and interactive solution approaches for MODM problems. ISGP is applicable to both linear and non-linear problems. It uses existing single objective optimization techniques and, hence, available computer codes utilizing these techniques can be adapted for use in ISGP. The non-dominance of the "best-compromise" solution is assured. The information required from the decision maker in each iteration is simple. The proposed method is illustrated by solving a nutrition problem.},

 abstract = {Heisenberg, in constructing quantum mechanics, explicitly followed certain principles exemplified, as he believed, in Einstein's construction of the special theory of relativity which for him was the paradigm for radical theoretic change in physics. These were the principles of (i) scientific realism, (ii) stability of background knowledge, (iii) E-observability, (iv) contextual re-interpretation, (v) pragmatic continuity, (vi) model continuity, (vii) simplicity. Fifty years later, in retrospect, Heisenberg added the following two: (viii) a principle of non-proliferation of competing theories - scientific revolutions are not a legitimate goal of physics - and (ix) a principle of tenacity - existing theories are to be conserved as far as possible. The conservative as well as the revolutionary potential of these principles is then discussed. A more penetrating philosophical criticism of these principles is postponed.},

  abstract = {A valuable overview of the most important ideas and results in statistical modeling Written by a highly-experienced author, Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models is a clear and comprehensive guide to the key concepts and results of linear statistical models. The book presents a broad, in-depth overview of the most commonly usedstatistical models by discussing the theory underlying the models, R software applications,and examples with crafted models to elucidate key ideas and promote practical modelbuilding. The book begins by illustrating the fundamentals of linear models, such as how the model-fitting projects the data onto a model vector subspace and how orthogonal decompositions of the data yield information about the effects of explanatory variables. Subsequently, the book covers the most popular generalized linear models, which include binomial and multinomial logistic regression for categorical data, and Poisson and negative binomial loglinear models for count data. Focusing on the theoretical underpinnings of these models, Foundations ofLinear and Generalized Linear Models also features:  An introduction to quasi-likelihood methods that require weaker distributional assumptions, such as generalized estimating equation methods An overview of linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models with random effects for clustered correlated data, Bayesian modeling, and extensions to handle problematic cases such as high dimensional problems Numerous examples that use R software for all text data analyses More than 400 exercises for readers to practice and extend the theory, methods, and data analysis A supplementary website with datasets for the examples and exercises  An invaluable textbook for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level students in statistics and biostatistics courses, Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models is also an excellent reference for practicing statisticians and biostatisticians, as well as anyone who is interested in learning about the most important statistical models for analyzing data.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

  abstract = {Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects.},

  abstract = {Ordinal predictors are commonly used in regression models. They are often incorrectly treated as either nominal or metric, thus under- or overestimating the information contained. Such practices may lead to worse inference and predictions compared to methods which are specifically designed for this purpose. We propose a new method for modelling ordinal predictors that applies in situations in which it is reasonable to assume their effects to be monotonic. The parameterization of such monotonic effects is realized in terms of a scale parameter b representing the direction and size of the effect and a simplex parameter modelling the normalized differences between categories. This ensures that predictions increase or decrease monotonically, while changes between adjacent categories may vary across categories. This formulation generalizes to interaction terms as well as multilevel structures. Monotonic effects may be applied not only to ordinal predictors, but also to other discrete variables for which a monotonic relationship is plausible. In simulation studies we show that the model is well calibrated and, if there is monotonicity present, exhibits predictive performance similar to or even better than other approaches designed to handle ordinal predictors. Using Stan, we developed a Bayesian estimation method for monotonic effects which allows us to incorporate prior information and to check the assumption of monotonicity. We have implemented this method in the R package brms, so that fitting monotonic effects in a fully Bayesian framework is now straightforward.},

  abstract = {Ordinal variables, although extremely common in psychology, are almost exclusively analyzed with statistical models that falsely assume them to be metric. This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

  abstract = {We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

  abstract = {Is moral judgment accomplished by intuition or conscious reasoning? An answer demands a detailed account of the moral principles in question. We investigated three principles that guide moral judgments: (a) Harm caused by action is worse than harm caused by omission, (b) harm intended as the means to a goal is worse than harm foreseen as the side effect of a goal, and (c) harm involving physical contact with the victim is worse than harm involving no physical contact. Asking whether these principles are invoked to explain moral judgments, we found that subjects generally appealed to the first and third principles in their justifications, but not to the second. This finding has significance for methods and theories of moral psychology: The moral principles used in judgment must be directly compared with those articulated in justification, and doing so shows that some moral principles are available to conscious reasoning whereas others are not.},

abstract = {This paper presents an operational metric for univariate unimodal probability distributions with finite first moments in [0,1], where 0 is maximally thin-tailed (Gaussian) and 1 is maximally fat-tailed. It is based on the question, “how much data does one need to make meaningful statements about a given dataset?” Applications: Among others, it •helps to determine the sample size n needed for statistical significance outside the Gaussian distribution,•helps to measure the speed of convergence to the Gaussian (or stable basin),•allows practical comparisons across classes of fat-tailed distributions,•allows the number of securities needed in portfolio construction to achieve a certain level of risk-reduction from diversification to be assessed,•helps in assessing risks under various settings, and•helps to explain some inconsistent attributes of the lognormal, depending on the parametrization of its variance. The literature in regard to asymptotic behavior is rich, but there is a large void regarding finite values of n, which are those that are needed for operational purposes. Background: Conventional measures of fat-tailedness, namely (1) the tail index for the power law class, and (2) the kurtosis for finite moment distributions, fail to apply to some distributions, and do not allow comparisons across classes and parametrization; that is, between power laws outside the Levy-stable basin, or power laws and distributions in other classes, or power laws for different numbers of summands. How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t distributed random variables with three degrees of freedom to one in a Levy-stable or a Lognormal class? How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t with three degrees of freedom to a single Student t with two degrees of freedom? We propose an operational and heuristic metric that allows us to compare n-summed independent variables under all distributions with finite first moments. The method is based on the rate of convergence of the law of large numbers for finite sums, specifically n-summands. We get either explicit expressions or simulation results and bounds for the lognormal, exponential, Pareto, and Student t distributions in their various calibrations, in addition to the general Pearson classes.}
