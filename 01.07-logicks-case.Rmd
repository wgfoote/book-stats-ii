# Quaestio: Whether Corporate Risk Disclosures Exhibit Logical Coherence

This quaestio integrates:

- formal logic,  
- managerial ethics,  
- and the metaphysics of intelligibility

Here is an example of [geopolitical exposure risk](https://www.asianfin.com/news/222491?utm_source=copilot.com) at NVIDIA.

## Objections

1. It seems that corporate MD&A and Risk Factor language is inherently inconsistent, since firms routinely assert both vulnerability and resilience, both risk and opportunity, both exposure and mitigation. Therefore, no coherent logical structure can be extracted.

2. Further, the conditional forms used in disclosures (“only if,” “may,” “could,” “unless”) are too vague to admit propositional Formalize. Their ambiguity defeats the precision required for deductive analysis.

3. Moreover, the complexity of modern supply chains (e.g., NVIDIA’s dependence on TSMC for fabrication and packaging) introduces causal entanglement, not discrete propositions. Thus, propositional logic is too coarse to capture the real structure of managerial claims.

## On the contrary

The *Rules* section of this chapter teaches that even complex statements can be decomposed into binary propositions and tested for consistency using the algebra of binary.  

And the Apostle says: *“Let your yes be yes and your no be no.”*  
Therefore, intelligibility is not only possible but required.

## I respond that

Corporate disclosures do exhibit a latent logical structure, even when the prose is hedged, qualified, or strategically ambiguous.  

Three insights guide the analysis:

### 1. Emergence of structure beneath ambiguity  

Risk language often appears fuzzy, but its *functional role* in MD&A is to articulate conditional dependencies:
- If X occurs, Y may follow.  
- Only if A is achieved, B will result.  
- Unless C is mitigated, D could arise.

These are precisely the forms your binary conditional $1 + x + xy$ is designed to encode.

### 2. Ethical intelligibility  

Managers owe stakeholders clarity about:
- what conditions threaten liquidity,  
- what dependencies constrain operations,  
- what assumptions underlie forecasts.

Logical consistency is not merely a technical property; it is a moral one.  
Incoherent disclosures obscure responsibility.

### 3. Pedagogical emergence  

By beginning with synthetic passages, we learn to:
- identify propositions,  
- translate English into logical form,  
- encode implications in binary,  
- test for consistency.

Then, by moving to actual MD&A‑style passages, we encounter the complexity of actual managerial communication.

## Application: Synthetic Passages

Below are three synthetic but realistic NVIDIA‑style passages, each followed by a propositional structure suitable for binary analysis.

### Passage 1 — Supply‑Chain Concentration

> “We depend on a limited number of suppliers for wafer fabrication and advanced packaging. If these suppliers cannot meet our demand, our ability to deliver products will be adversely affected. Our suppliers will meet fabrication demand. Our suppliers may not meet packaging demand.”

Let:

- $F$: fabrication demand is met  
- $P$: packaging demand is met  
- $D$: we deliver products on schedule  

Formalize:

- $\lnot F \oplus \lnot P \rightarrow \lnot D$  
- $F$  
- $\lnot P$

we test whether $D$ must be false.

### Passage 2 — Geopolitical Exposure

> “A disruption in Taiwan could materially affect our supply chain. Taiwan will not experience a major disruption. Our supply chain will be materially affected.”

Let:

- $T$: Taiwan disruption  
- $S$: supply chain materially affected  

Formalize:

- $T \rightarrow S$  
- $\lnot T$  
- $S$

we test whether the set is consistent.

### Passage 3 — Customer Concentration

> “A small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue. If one of these customers reduces orders, our financial results may be adversely affected. No major customer will reduce orders. Our financial results will be adversely affected.”

Let:

- $C$: major customer reduces orders  
- $R$: financial results adversely affected  

Formalize:

- $C \rightarrow R$  
- $\lnot C$  
- $R$

We test whether the set is consistent.

## Replies to the Objections

### Reply to Objection 1

While managerial language is often hedged, its underlying structure is conditional. Once decomposed, many passages are perfectly consistent—or reveal subtle contradictions.

### Reply to Objection 2  

Ambiguity does not preclude formalization. The binary algebra handles “only if,” “unless,” and “may” through standard encodings in a principled framework.

### Reply to Objection 3

Even complex supply chains (e.g., NVIDIA → TSMC → Foxconn → Supermicro) can be represented as binary dependencies. Propositional logic does not capture all causal nuance, but it captures the core logical commitments managers make.

## Buildinig a logicks technology

Below we’ll treat each passage’s propositions as variables in $\{0,1\}$, with:

- Negation:  
  \[
  \lnot x = 1 + x
  \]
- Conjunction:  
  \[
  x \land y = xy
  \]
- Disjunction (exclusive “or”):  
  \[
  x \oplus y = x + y + xy
  \]
- Implication $x \rightarrow y$: encoded as the truth-value polynomial  
  \[
  x \rightarrow y \equiv 1 + x + xy
  \]  
  (This equals $1$ in all truth-table rows except $x=1, y=0$, where it equals $0$.)

We clarify our approach with rules learnt from basic arithmetic. *Addition* is defined as addition of integers, but restricted to modulo 2, with only two possible values $\{0,1\}$.^[@burris2021SEP-algebra-logic-tradition develops a sweeping history of the progress, decline, and revitalization of algebraic logic. @burris2013horn augment Boole's algebraic logic with a Rule of 0 and 1 founded on Horn sentences. This is significant because of the hermeneutical anti-compositional principle of building up an understanding of reasoned arguments from its propositional elements and in turn from terms. We take into account the argument as a whole and the reciprocal interaction of the whole argument with its components.] 

- These values are the terms and the propositions themselves, not to mention the possible outcomes of sequences of propositions we would call an argument. 

- When we recall our basic maths and modulo arithmetic as a clock, the hands on this clock can sit at 0 or 1. If the hand is at 1 and we add 1 to this setting we end up at, yes, 0. A regular OR in many languages would often mean and/or, an inclusive OR, an either one or the other or both. The XOR excludes any possibility in common between two propositions. Propositions are mutually exclusive of one another. Here is a table to help us. 

$$
\begin{array}{c | c c}
+ (XOR)   &  0    &  1 \\ \hline
0         &  0    &  1 \\
1         &  1    &  0 
\end{array}
$$

Addition with boolean values $\{0,1\}$ is the same as that of the logical exclusive OR operations, XOR. Since each element equals its opposite, subtraction is thus the same operation as addition, so that $0-0=0$,  $0-1=1$ (remembering the clock with just two settings!), $1-0=1$, and $1-1=0$, anyway, all equivalent to the $+$ rules. In words, it is **one or the other, not both**.

The multiplication is multiplication modulo 2 (see the table below), and on boolean variables corresponds to the logical AND operation. Here is the **both** proposition with two terms.

$$
\begin{array}{c | c c}
\times (AND)   &  0    &  1 \\ \hline
0         &  0    &  0 \\
1         &  0    &  1 
\end{array}
$$

The NOT logic simply takes a 0 and flips it to 1, and if 1 flips it to zero.

$$
\begin{array}{c | c}
\neg (NOT)   &  1+x   \\ \hline
0            &  1      \\
1            &  0      
\end{array}
$$

With these three operations we can evaluate any logical statement. And we must remember that NOT is not the subtraction operation we are very familiar with from non-binary algebra. Some folks will write $\overline x$ instead of $\neg$. 

Here is a table of several useful expressions based on AND, XOR, and NOT. For any two propositions $x$ and $y$ whose values can only take on a 0 or 1, so that when $x=0$, we mean $x$ is false, otherwise (that is, $x=1$) true.^[Boole has the negation of $x$ as $1-x$. We follow @carnielli2015method $1+x$, given that all subtractions end up being addition in mod 2 arithmetic.]

$$
\begin{array}{c c | c c c c c}
  &   & AND & XOR & NOT & y \mid x & SUB \\ \hline
x & y & xy & x+y & 1+x & 1+x+xy    & x-y=x+y\\ \hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ \hline
x & y & x \land y & x \oplus y & \neg x,\,\overline x & x \rightarrow y \\ \hline
x & y &     -      & (x \lor y) \land \neg (x \land y) & \neg x \lor y & \neg (x \oplus (x \land y)) \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The last row describes the algebraic operations in term of propositional logic as applied to Boolean values of $\{0, 1\}$. I can easily get lost in that row. I tend to prefer 9th grade algebraic expressions. 

The last column uses the negative to *SUB*tract $y$ from $x$. We might be tempted to say that $x-y= x+ (1+y) = 1+x+y=1+(x+y)$ so that the subtraction operator is the "NOT the ADD" operator. Nice try! We must always go back to the most literal, most primitive operations, namely the addition and multiplication rules which govern these more derived expressions.  

That next to the last column will deserves some rapt attention since it forms the foundation of conditional (at the least reasonably expected) probability. But first some very helpful derived relationships will make our work going forward a lot smoother.

$$
\begin{array}{c c | c c c c c}
x & x & xx=x^2 & xxx=x^3 & x+x=2x & x+x+x=3x & x-x=x+x\\ \hline
0 & 0 & 0      & 0       & 0      & 0        & 0      \\
0 & 0 & 0      & 0       & 0      & 0        & 0      \\
1 & 1 & 1      & 1       & 0      & 1        & 0      \\
1 & 1 & 1      & 1       & 0      & 1        & 0      \\ \hline
  & = & x      & x       & 0      & x        & 0      \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

What happens here is that there are no monomial terms of any higher degree than 1; no quadratic or cubic terms at all. Two propositions literally cancel each other, as the Germans might say an _Aufhebung_ event. But three terms will return the single proposition. All of this is the result of the modulo 2 arithmetic with which we constrain ourselves.

We now study $y|x=1+x+xy$ in three moves. The first move is to realize that, at least for binary data, Aristotle discovered four logical forms, two in the *affirmative*, two *negative*; two *universal*, two *contingent*. Medieval logicians called the two affirmative Forms A and I for the first two vowels in _AffIrmo_, Latin for "I affirm," and the two negative forms E and O from the Latin _nEgO_, "I deny." Together they form the **Square of Opposition**. Here S is the subject and P the predicate. Any subject S signifies what it is we are talking about, say, rain. Any predicate P signifies what the subject is about, say, falling to the ground. 

Equations and identities do not have a subject or a predicate and themselves might be the subject or predicate. But all propositions do have a subject and a predicate, just like in 3rd grade when we learned to write and speak in complete sentences, that is, in propositions, which contain a subject (usually a noun) and a predicate (usually a verb). We assume that when we apply the forms to concrete examples of propositions, the content of the form, that is, the S and the P, exist. For Thomas Aquinas signs are physical manifestations that allow us to understand something beyond their immediate appearance, like a footprint manifesting someone's presence or smoke manifesting fire. This something with an immediate appearance we will assume without further bother, that it somehow exists. Perhaps we append the particle _any_ to S and P to get any rain and any falling (of rain).

We build a table of logical forms in this first move. In the table, _decisions_ is the subject S, what we are talking about, and _are rational_ is the predicate P, what the subject is about.

$$
\begin{array}{c | c | c | c }
Form  & Proposition & Sentence & Algebra \\
\hline
A     & \text{All S is P}        & \text{"All decisions are rational."}         & a(1+b) = 0      \\ 
E     & \text{No S is P}         & \text{"Not all decisions are rational."}     & ab = 0          \\
I     & \text{Some S is P}       & \text{"Some decisions are rational."}        & ab \neq 0       \\
O     & \text{Some S is not P}   & \text{"Some decisions are not rational."}    & a(1+b) \neq 0   \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The second move is to parse the Form A proposition "All decisions (a) are rational (b)." Logically $a$ and not $b$ is false (0) in Form A, that is, algebraicly, $a(1+b) = 0$. "Decisions"  and "not-rational" is false, that is, inconsistent according to Form A. The obverse must be true, that "No-decisions are not-rational," as if we might be able to interpret this double negative. One more swipe at interpretation is called for. To say that "all of anything is something else" is, effectively to identify "anything" with "something else."  If this statement is true, as we are positing here in the form, then it cannot be true that both "anything = $a$" and "not-something else = $(1+b)$" can coexist. Thus the logical Form A seems to admit a very basic principle we would hold alongside all other principles (Aristotle called this _metaphysics_), namely, the _Principle of Non-Contradiction_. Yes, we cannot, so far it seems, to be in two places at the same time.

In a third move, we use the NOT operation on Form A. We recall we are using "+" as exclusive OR, XOR with this algebraic rearrangement.

$$
\begin{array}{c| c l}
statement & reason \\ 
\hline
1 & a(1+b) = 0     & \text{Form A definition}  \\
2 & 1 + a(1+b) = 1 & \text{Symmetric property} \\
3 & 1 + a + ab = 1 & \text{Distribution of multiplication over addition property} \\
\hline
4 & a \rightarrow b = b \mid a & \text{a gives some information to b} \\ 
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Simply negating (using 1+) the Form A definition reveals a conditional relationship between $a$ and $b$. Saying that $a$ AND $not-b$ is possible when we negate the Form A requirement, means $a$ does share something with $b$. So-called "implication" means that a shares a's information with b. This is the primary meaning we ascribe to "a conditions b", $b \mid a$. We now have all the ingredients to use this framework to discover a principled path to the expectations approach to probability, that is, counting the ways in which data are consistent with hypotheses. But before we enter that particular room, we need to argue a bit more, that is, discover valid and invalid logical arguments.

Each sentence in the passage becomes a polynomial equation of the form “expression $= 1$” (true) or “variable $= 0/1$”.

#### Passage 1: Supply‑chain concentration

> “We depend on a limited number of suppliers for wafer fabrication and advanced packaging. If these suppliers cannot meet our demand, our ability to deliver products will be adversely affected. Our suppliers will meet fabrication demand. Our suppliers may not meet packaging demand.”

Let:

- $F$: fabrication demand is met.
- $P$: packaging demand is met.
- $D$: we deliver products on schedule.

We formalized:

1. $\lnot F \oplus \lnot P \rightarrow \lnot D$  
2. $F$  
3. $\lnot P$

Step 1: Encode each statement.

- (2) $F$ is true:  
  \[
  F = 1
  \]

- (3) $\lnot P$ is true:  
  \[
  \lnot P = 1 + P = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P = 0
  \]

- (1) $\lnot F \oplus \lnot P \rightarrow \lnot D$:

  First compute $\lnot F$ and $\lnot P$:

  \[
  \lnot F = 1 + F,\quad \lnot P = 1 + P
  \]

  Disjunction:

  \[
  \lnot F \oplus \lnot P = (1+F) \oplus (1+P)
  \]
  \[
  = (1+F) + (1+P) + (1+F)(1+P)
  \]
  Simplify:

  \[
  (1+F) + (1+P) = F + P
  \]
  \[
  (1+F)(1+P) = 1 + F + P + FP
  \]
  So

  \[
  \lnot F \oplus \lnot P = F + P + 1 + F + P + FP = 1 + FP
  \]

  So the antecedent is $1 + FP$. The consequent is $\lnot D = 1 + D$.

  The implication polynomial is:

  \[
  (1 + FP) \rightarrow (1 + D) = 1 + (1 + FP) + (1 + FP)(1 + D)
  \]

  Compute:

  \[
  1 + (1+FP) = FP
  \]
  \[
  (1+FP)(1+D) = 1 + D + FP + FPD
  \]

  So:

  \[
  1 + (1 + FP) + (1+FP)(1+D) = FP + 1 + D + FP + FPD = 1 + D + FPD
  \]

  Therefore (1) says:

  \[
  1 + D + FPD = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad D + FPD = 0
  \]

Step 2: Substitute known values.

We already have $F = 1, P = 0$. Then:

\[
FPD = (1)(0)D = 0
\]

So the equation $D + FPD = 0$ becomes:

\[
D + 0 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad D = 0
\]

**Conclusion**

A satisfying assignment is:

\[
F = 1,\quad P = 0,\quad D = 0
\]

All three statements can be true simultaneously. The set is logically consistent, and the algebra forces the natural managerial reading: if packaging capacity fails, on‑time delivery fails.

#### Passage 2: Geopolitical exposure

> “A disruption in Taiwan could materially affect our supply chain. Taiwan will not experience a major disruption. Our supply chain will be materially affected.”

Let:

- $T$: Taiwan disruption.
- $S$: supply chain materially affected.

Formalize:

1. $T \rightarrow S$  
2. $\lnot T$  
3. $S$

Step 1: Encode each statement.

- (1) $T \rightarrow S$:

  \[
  T \rightarrow S = 1 + T + TS = 1
  \]
  So:
  \[
  1 + T + TS = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T + TS = 0
  \]

- (2) $\lnot T$:

  \[
  1 + T = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = 0
  \]

- (3) $S$:

  \[
  S = 1
  \]

Step 2: Substitute into (1).

With $T = 0$:

\[
T + TS = 0 + 0\cdot S = 0
\]

So equation (1) becomes $0 = 0$, automatically satisfied for any $S$. We also impose $S = 1$ from (3).

**Conclusion**

A satisfying assignment is:

\[
T = 0,\quad S = 1
\]

All three statements are jointly consistent. The algebra highlights a conceptual point for we: supply‑chain stress may have causes other than the Taiwan scenario flagged in (1).

#### Passage 3: Customer concentration

> “A small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue. If one of these customers reduces orders, our financial results may be adversely affected. No major customer will reduce orders. Our financial results will be adversely affected.”

Let:

- $C$: a major customer reduces orders.
- $R$: financial results adversely affected.

Formalize:

1. $C \rightarrow R$  
2. $\lnot C$  
3. $R$

Step 1: Encode each statement.

- (1) $C \rightarrow R$:

  \[
  C \rightarrow R = 1 + C + CR = 1
  \]
  So:
  \[
  1 + C + CR = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C + CR = 0
  \]

- (2) $\lnot C$:

  \[
  1 + C = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = 0
  \]

- (3) $R$:

  \[
  R = 1
  \]

Step 2: Substitute into (1).

With $C = 0$:

\[
C + CR = 0 + 0\cdot R = 0
\]

Equation (1) becomes $0 = 0$, automatically satisfied for any $R$. Together with $R = 1$, we get the assignment:

\[
C = 0,\quad R = 1
\]

**Conclusion**

The set is consistent. Again, the algebra cleanly registers an interpretive point: adverse financial results can occur even without the particular customer‑concentration scenario highlighted in (1).

### Note on the analytical requirements for ethical disclosure

When we translate MD&A and risk‑factor prose into precise propositions, and then further into $ \mathbb{F}_2 $ equations, they are not merely doing a technical exercise. They are learning what it means to speak truthfully under conditions of complexity.

A few points we might consider as we reflect on the work of our hands, brains together:

- *Clarity as respect for the neighbor.* Investors, employees, suppliers, and communities all stand downstream of these disclosures. To speak in ways that are internally contradictory, or so vague as to defeat intelligibility, is to treat those neighbors as means rather than ends. Logical consistency is not sufficient for ethical communication, but it is necessary.

- *The humility of stating conditions.* A manager who says, “If $C$, then $R$” is admitting contingency, dependence, vulnerability. Your algebra makes those dependencies concrete. To acknowledge them truthfully is a form of humility: our flourishing is not self‑generated but conditioned by others (TSMC, customers, regulators, macro conditions).

- *The danger of strategic obscurity.* Some disclosures are engineered to sound cautious while saying almost nothing determinate. When a student cannot even *formulate* a proposition or a polynomial from a sentence, that is already an ethical signal: the language has been constructed to evade accountability. The discipline of logic becomes a training in discernment: where is the “yes” and where is the “no”?

- *The vocation of the analyst.* An analyst on your project is not merely someone who manipulates symbols. She is someone called to seek intelligibility in the world: to surface the real dependencies, the actual risks, the genuine exposures, and to resist both cynicism (“it’s all spin”) and naiveté (“they must mean exactly what they say”). The algebra is a tool for that vocation.

- *Truthfulness as a shared project.* Finally, these exercises model something communal. We work together to check each other’s translations, test each other’s systems for consistency, notice where an assumption has been smuggled in. This mirrors what ought to happen in an organization: *cross‑functional dialogue that insists disclosures be both accurate and intelligible.*

We can close the section with a simple exhortation:

> When you put a statement into symbols and test it, you are practicing a habit that matters far beyond this course. You are learning to ask of any claim—corporate, political, even personal—“Is this coherent? What else must be true if this is true?” That habit, exercised in love of the truth and love of the neighbor, is part of what makes disclosure ethical rather than merely compliant.

## 1. Paraphrased NVIDIA‑style risk subsection

This is synthetic but grounded in NVIDIA’s real risk profile: extreme dependence on TSMC in Taiwan, geopolitical exposure, and supply‑chain concentration.

> Risk: Dependence on a single advanced foundry in a geopolitically exposed region
>
> We rely on a limited number of third‑party foundries to manufacture and package our most advanced GPUs. In particular, we depend on a single leading‑edge foundry located primarily in Taiwan to fabricate and provide advanced packaging for substantially all of our highest‑margin data center products. If this foundry, or its facilities in Taiwan, become unable to operate at planned capacity due to geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, export controls, or other disruptions, our supply of advanced GPUs could be materially reduced or delayed. Any such disruption could materially and adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer demand, our revenue growth, and our operating results.  
> At the same time, we are investing in supply‑chain resiliency initiatives, including engaging additional foundry partners and diversifying advanced packaging capacity in other regions. These initiatives are designed to mitigate, but cannot fully eliminate, the risks associated with our current geographic and supplier concentration.

Goal: Is this logically coherent? What must be true, if the company stands by these claims?

## 2. Propositional decomposition

Define propositional variables:

- $F$: The single leading‑edge foundry in Taiwan operates at planned capacity.  
- $S$: Our supply of advanced GPUs is materially sufficient (neither materially reduced nor delayed).  
- $R$: Our ability to fulfill customer demand, revenue growth, and operating results are not materially and adversely affected.  
- $I$: Our resiliency initiatives (additional foundries, diversified packaging) are effective in materially mitigating the supply‑chain risk.  

We also need some “disruption” variable:

- $D$: The foundry or its Taiwanese facilities are unable to operate at planned capacity due to geopolitical or other disruptions.

From the text:

1. If the foundry in Taiwan becomes unable to operate at planned capacity, then our supply of advanced GPUs could be materially reduced or delayed.  
   \[
   D \rightarrow \lnot S
   \]

2. If our supply of advanced GPUs is materially reduced or delayed, then our ability to fulfill demand, revenue growth, and operating results are materially and adversely affected.  
   \[
   \lnot S \rightarrow \lnot R
   \]

3. We depend on this single foundry in Taiwan for substantially all of our highest‑margin data center products. (Descriptive—bakes in the importance of $F$; no direct conditional yet.)

4. Our resiliency initiatives are designed to mitigate, but not fully eliminate, the risks associated with geographic and supplier concentration.  
   Intuitively:  
   - If $I$ is effective, then some disruptions that would otherwise have caused $\lnot S$ might not do so.  
   - But “not fully eliminate” means: even if $I$ is effective, there exist possible disruptions for which $D$ still leads to $\lnot S$.  
   We can encode this in a minimal way:
   - $I \rightarrow M$, where $M$ = “some risk is mitigated.” (We’ll treat this as background, not central to the consistency test.)
   - And crucially we *do not* assert $I \rightarrow \lnot(D \rightarrow \lnot S)$ or its negation; the text is careful.

5. The company does not actually assert any of:
   - “$D$ will occur,”  
   - “$D$ will not occur,”  
   - “$S$,”  
   - “$\lnot S$,”  
   - “$R$,”  
   - “$\lnot R$.”  
   It speaks in conditional and designed to mitigate language.

For the algebra, focus on the core conditionals:

- (A) $D \rightarrow \lnot S$  
- (B) $\lnot S \rightarrow \lnot R$

Everything else is context.

## 3. Encoding in $ \mathbb{F}_2 $

Let each proposition be in $\{0,1\}$, with:

- $\lnot x = 1 + x$  
- $x \land y = xy$  
- Implication $x \rightarrow y = 1 + x + xy$  

### Statement (A): $D \rightarrow \lnot S$

\[
D \rightarrow \lnot S = 1 + D + D(1 + S) = 1 + D + D + DS = 1 + DS
\]

Truth of (A) means:

\[
1 + DS = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad DS = 0
\]

So (A) imposes the constraint:

\[
DS = 0
\]

### Statement (B): $\lnot S \rightarrow \lnot R$

First compute:

\[
\lnot S = 1 + S,\quad \lnot R = 1 + R
\]

So:

\[
\lnot S \rightarrow \lnot R = 1 + (1+S) + (1+S)(1+R)
\]

Compute step by step:

\[
1 + (1+S) = S
\]
\[
(1+S)(1+R) = 1 + R + S + SR
\]

So:

\[
1 + (1+S) + (1+S)(1+R) = S + 1 + R + S + SR = 1 + R + SR
\]

Truth of (B) means:

\[
1 + R + SR = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad R + SR = 0
\]

So (B) imposes:

\[
R + SR = 0
\]

## 4. Consistency analysis in $ \mathbb{F}_2 $

Our system is:

- $DS = 0$  
- $R + SR = 0$

There are no direct equations fixing the actual values of $D, S, R$; only relationships.

We check for existence of at least one satisfying assignment.

### Case analysis

#### Case 1: $S = 0$

Then:

- $DS = D \cdot 0 = 0$ — automatically satisfies $DS = 0$.  
- For the second equation:  
  \[
  R + SR = R + 0\cdot R = R
  \]
  So we need:
  \[
  R = 0
  \]

So with $S = 0$, any $D \in \{0,1\}$ works, provided $R = 0$.  
Thus we have satisfying assignments like:
- $D = 0, S = 0, R = 0$  
- $D = 1, S = 0, R = 0$

Both reflect the intended reading: if supply is materially reduced/delayed ($S=0$), then results must be adversely affected ($R=0$).

#### Case 2: $S = 1$

Then:

- $DS = D\cdot 1 = D$, so $DS = 0$ implies:
  \[
  D = 0
  \]

- For the second equation:
  \[
  R + SR = R + 1\cdot R = R + R = 0
  \]

So this is automatically satisfied for any $R$.  
Thus we have satisfying assignments like:
- $D = 0, S = 1, R = 0$  
- $D = 0, S = 1, R = 1$

Here, if the foundry is *not* disrupted ($D=0$), (A) places no further constraint on $S$; if supply is fine ($S=1$), (B) places no constraint on $R$.

### Verdict

There are many satisfying assignments. The system is logically consistent.

Moreover, the structure is *exactly* what you would hope for ethically:

- If disruption occurs and propagates through supply, results must suffer.  
- If there is no disruption, or if supply holds, results may or may not suffer for other reasons—not specified here.

No contradiction; no hidden guarantees.

## 5. Interpretive and ethical commentary

### Logical interpretation

we can now see:

- The subsection is purely conditional: “If $D$, then $\lnot S$; if $\lnot S$, then $\lnot R$.”  
- NVIDIA‑style language does not assert that $D$ will occur; it does not promise that $S$ will hold.  
- The role of resiliency initiatives ($I$) is explicitly modest: “designed to mitigate, but cannot fully eliminate.” That means the firm refuses to encode a global implication like $I \rightarrow S$, which would be logically fragile.

Formally: the passage asserts necessary relations, not actual outcomes.

### Ethical note on analytical requirements for disclosure

There is a pedagogically powerful and pastoral point here:

1. Ethical disclosure requires that conditionals be honest about propagation.  
   If executives know that a disruption at TSMC ($D$) would devastate supply ($\lnot S$) and results ($\lnot R$), it would be ethically suspect to describe the risk in vague, non‑committal language. The chain $D \rightarrow \lnot S \rightarrow \lnot R$ is a *moral obligation* to articulate, not merely a technical dependency.

2. But honesty also requires restraint.  
   They do not (and should not) promise: “Our resiliency initiatives guarantee that disruptions won’t matter.” An honest risk section resists both false assurance and performative alarmism. Your logic tools help we see where a sentence would secretly encode a guarantee or a contradiction.

3. Analytical work is part of justice.  
   To know that $D \rightarrow \lnot S$ and $\lnot S \rightarrow \lnot R$ and then not disclose it is a failure of justice toward counterparties and the broader public. The algebraic exercise is a rehearsal in noticing hidden dependencies and insisting that they be made explicit.

4. Formation in prudence.  
   When we work through the system and see that the risk language is consistent but sobering, they are being trained not only to detect deception but to practice prudence:  
   - What is not said?  
   - What variables are left open?  
   - Are there plausible disruptions the firm has not modeled?

5. Truthfulness as shared discernment.  
   Analysts, auditors, boards, and regulators are all, in principle, co‑discerners of the truth about a firm’s condition. Your exercises invite we into that vocation: not to weaponize cleverness, but to serve intelligibility and the good of neighbors through disciplined reasoning.
